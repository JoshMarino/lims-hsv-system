= Introduction =

This section covers the steps required to get the code running in Visual Studio 2K8.

= Quick Note =

The instructions will mirror the setup on the current desktop that the code has been known to run on.  This does not mean that it will not work with a slightly modified configuration (i.e. Windows Vista vs Windows XP or Visual Studio 2K5 instead of VS2K8).


= Requirements =
  * Intel's OpenCV library (v1.0)
  * Silicon Software SDK library (v3.2)
  * Silicon Softwre MicroEnable III (meIII) Frame Grabber
  * Photonfocus MV-D1024-TrackCam ("TrackCam") Camera
  * Windows XP SP2
  * Desktop computer with an available PCI slot

= Installation =

== Hardware ==

Install all hardware as directed by the Photonfocus and Silicon Software manuals.

== Software ==

Install Visual Studio, OpenCV, Silicon Software Driver and SDK, and Photonfocus's PFRemote.
